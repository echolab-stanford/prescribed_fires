# Prescribed and low-intensity/severity fires project

In this repo we have all the replication files to retrieve, process and analyse all the data
relative to the prescribed papers project. Some of the code here is taken from:
 - [CBPS](https://github.com/apoorvalal/covariate_balancing_propensity_scores)
 - [dnbr_extract](https://github.com/echolab-stanford/dnbr_extract)

 For now all things here are very experimental!
